collections of things & relationships (nodes) and connections between them (edges)
undirected: no directions on edges - social network of people
directed: directions on edges - internet and web page links

3 ways to represent:
1. adjacency list: assoc each vertix w collection of neighboring vertices/edges
var undirectedG = {
    n1: ["n2", "n3"],
    n2: ["n1"],
    n3: ["n3"]
}
var undirectedGArr = [
    [1, 2], //node1
    [0],    //node 2
    [2],    //node 3
]

2. adjacency matrix - matix of nums where num reps an edge (0 = no edge, 1 = edge)
elements & nodes needs to be same amount
good to rep a directed graph
var adjMat = [
    [0, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0]
]

3. incidence matrix: 2 dimensional array. rows = nodes, col = edges. so uneven number of rows and columns can exist.
for directed graph -1 for edge leaving a node, 1 entering a node 
var incMatDir = [
    [1, 0, -1, 1],
    [-1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, -1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, -1]
]

Can have weighted edges, depenging on application
